# Awesome Pelican


A curated list of awesome open-source libraries, software and resources that are directly related to Pelican, the static-site-generator.

Inspired by [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python).

## What's different here from official lists ?
While official website should keep all the plugins, themes and resources listed, here we'll try to maintain only the well-maintained, stable, essential or popular ones. So that, a new not-so-techie Pelican beginner can hit the ground running using this list.
